/**
 * Procedural building facade.
 *
 * Windows are generated in the fragment shader rather than textured, so the
 * whole city stays one draw call per pass and no atlas has to be authored,
 * loaded or kept in sync with tower heights.
 *
 * Two details matter for it to read as architecture rather than a grid:
 *
 *  - Floor height is constant in WORLD units. The box geometry is a unit cube
 *    scaled per instance, so a naive `uv.y` grid would stretch: tall towers
 *    would get tall windows. The vertical cell count is derived from the
 *    instance's own Y scale instead, which keeps every floor the same height
 *    across the skyline.
 *  - Roofs get no windows. Without the normal check, the top face of every
 *    box is tiled too, and the city reads as a circuit board from above.
